GROUP MEMBERS:
-Alexandre Correia
-Henrique Silva

ADDITIONAL SPECIFICATIONS:
-In the cases where the project guide didnÂ´t specify the position of the player when he is destroyed, we decided that he 
 would never occupy the position of the object that had destroyed him, to make it easier to identify the cause of his destruction.

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT STATE:
-The objective of the project was globally achieved and all the goals were acomplished.
-We added our own feature in the leaderboard as we did in our previous project by sorting it in alphabetical order in case 
 of a time draw, but this time we used the sort function included in algorithm library and an operator in the winner class.

MAIN DIFFICULTIES:
-Our main difficulty was related with to fact that we had to rethink some parts of the previous project so that we could
 rewrite it efficiently using object-oriented programming.
-However, in the end it turned out to be faster to code using OOP than just with functions as we had done previously. And
 the code became more readable.

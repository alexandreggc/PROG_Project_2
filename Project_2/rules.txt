In this game the player is placed in a maze made up of high-voltage fences and posts,
some of this are electrified posts represented by '*' and others non-electrified represented by '+'.
There are also some exit doors that the player can enter to escape the maze and win the game.

There are also some interceptor robots that will try to destroy the player. If the player touches the 
maze or any of these robots, that is the end of the game and the player is represented by 'h'. The
robots are also destroyed when they touch the fences/posts or when they collide with each other.

If they collide with an eletrified post they stay in the same position and that post loses its 
capability of electrocution. However, if the collision is with a non-electrified post then the robot
takes its position. In the case that two robots collide they are represented by only one destroyed
robot 'r'. If all of them are destroyed, the player wins the game.

Every time the player moves in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a
contiguous cell, each robot moves one cell closer to the new player's location, in whichever
direction is the shortest path.
The robots have no vision sensors but they have an accurate odor sensor that allows
them to follow the player!

We wish you good luck...
